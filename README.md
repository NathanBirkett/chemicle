# chemicle

Chemicle is a varation on the popular word guessing game Wordle. It's like Wordle, but instead of guessing a 5 letter word, the player has to guess an ionic compound.

This was one of my first programming projects, so the code is very quick and dirty. It uses java swing to create a UI, some object orientation, and action events. This project gave me practice with how to do object oriented programming, how to use java swing, how to use action events, lots of string manipulation, basic data structures, and exception handling.

How to play: Type in any valid ionic compound (If you don't know what that is... this game will be a bit tricky for you). A symbol or number will be highlighted green if it is correct, and a symbol will be highlighted yellow if it has the same charge as the correct one.
